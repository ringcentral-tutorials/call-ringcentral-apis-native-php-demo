      ### Clone and Setup the project
      Clone the project from GitHub and install the `dotenv` module.

  .step(data-title='Set Environment Variables', data-file='../environment/dotenv-sandbox')
    :markdown
     ### Set Environment Variables
     Copy the Client id and Client secret and add them to the `.env-sandbox` file.
     ```
     RC_CLIENT_ID=
     RC_CLIENT_SECRET=
     ```
     Add the account login credentials to the `.env-sandbox` file.
     ```
     RC_USERNAME=
     RC_PASSWORD=
     RC_EXTENSION=
     ```

     If you want to specify variables for your production environment, repeat this step for the `.env-production` file.

  .step(data-title='Getting started', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='1-2')
    :markdown
      ### Getting started

      Let's get started by creating a file named `ringcentral.php` and include dependent libraries.

  .step(data-title='Load the environment variables', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='4-17')
    :markdown
      ### Load the environment variables
      Read the ENVIRONMENT value from the `.env` file and load the `.env-sandbox` or `.env-production` accordingly.

      ### Specify a .txt file to keep the authentication data
      For the sandbox environment, we save the data to the `tokens_sb.txt`.

      For the production environment, we save the data to the `tokens_pd.txt`.

      In your real application, you may want to keep the authentication data in a database. Or keep the file in a hidden place because it contains the access token and the refresh token!

  .step(data-title='Create a reusable class', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='19-21')
    :markdown
      ### Create a reusable class
      To make this tutorial code reusable and extensible, we define the `RingCentral` class and implement a few utility functions.
      ```
      authenticate()
      get()
      post()
      ```

  .step(data-title='Implement authentication - 1', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='23-36')
    :markdown
      ### Implement authentication - 1

      Let's implement the `authenticate()` function to handle platform authentication.

      1) Specify the `$url` variable by adding the `/restapi/oauth/token` endpoint to the platform server URL we defined in the configuration .env-[environment] file.

      2) Specify the `$basic` authorization string by joining the client Id with the client secret separated by a colon ":".

      3) Define the `$headers` variable with the `Content-Type`, `Accept` and `Authorization` for the basic auth scheme.

      4) Define the `$body` object with the `grant_type`, `username` and `password`. We encode the body for just in the case the username is an email address which has special characters.

  .step(data-title='Implement authentication - 2', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='56-87')
    :markdown
      ### Implement authentication - 2

      1) Set curl options and use the POST method to send the authentication request.

      2) Handle `$curlError` and check the `$httpCode`. If the `$httpCode` is 200, we decode the `$strResponse` to create a JSON object `$jsonObj`.

      3) Define a `$tokensObj` variable and assign the `$jsonObj` to the "tokens" key/value pair. We also create the current timestamp and assign it to the "timestamp" key/value pair.

      4) Save the `$tokensObj` into a local file. I will discuss about how to use the file in the next step.

      5) Extract the `access_token` from the `$jsonObj` and keep the token in the class `$this->access_token` variable.

  .step(data-title='Implement authentication - 3', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='37-54')
    :markdown
      ### Implement authentication - 3

      We can avoid posting an authentication request every time we need access to the platform by checking if the access token is still valid.

      To do that, we check the existence of the `$tokens_file` file.

      If the file exists, we read the file content and specify the `$expire_time` variable by subtracting the `$tokensObj->timestamp` from the current time. Then compare the `$expire_time` with the access token expiration time `$tokensObj->tokens->expires_in`.

      If the `$expire_time` is less than the `$tokensObj->tokens->token_expires_in`, it means that the access token is still valid. So we save the `$tokensObj->tokens->access_token` to the class `$this->access_token`.

      If the `$expire_time` is greater than the access token expiration time, it means that the access token has expired. So we move on to compare the `$expire_time` with the refresh token expiration time `$tokensObj->tokens->refresh_token_expires_in`.

      If  the `$expire_time` is less than the `$tokensObj->tokens->refresh_token_expires_in`, it means that the  refresh token is still valid. So we can use it to request for a new access token. In this case, we redefine the `$body` with the `grant_type` value is "refresh_token", and the `refresh_token` value is the actual refresh token read from the local file. Then we proceed to call the post request as discussed in the previous step.

      If the `$tokens_file` does not exist, we proceed the authentication as discussed in the previous step.

  .step(data-title='GET request implementation', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='89-126')
    :markdown
      ### GET request implementation
      Now we implement the `get()` function to handle HTTP GET requests:

      1) Call the `authenticate()` function to handle the authentication and get the access token.

      2) Specify the `$url` variable by adding the `$endpoint` to the platform server URL we defined in the configuration .env-[environment] file.

      3) Call the http_build_query() function to build query parameters from the `$params` then add it to the `$url`.

      4) Define the `$headers` variable with the "Accept" and "Authorization" key/value pairs with the "Authorization" scheme is "Bearer" followed by the access token.

      5) Set curl options and send the GET request to RingCentral platform.

      6) Handle `$curlError` and check the `$httpCode` then return the `$strResponse`.

  .step(data-title='POST request implementation', data-file='../ringcentral.php' data-highlight='128-169')
    :markdown
      ### POST request implementation
      Now we implement the `post` function to handle HTTP POST requests

      1) Call the `authenticate()` function to handle the authentication and get the access token.

      2) Specify the `$url` variable by adding the `$endpoint` to the platform server URL we defined in the configuration .env-[environment] file.

      3) Define the `$body` variable and set the `$params` as its value.

      4) Define the `$headers` variable with the "Content-Type", "Accept" and "Authorization" key/value pairs  with the "Authorization" scheme is "Bearer" followed by the access token.

      5) Set curl options and send the POST request to RingCentral platform.

      6) Handle `$curlError` and check the `$httpCode` then return the `$strResponse`.

  .step(data-title='Call RingCentral Platform APIs', data-file='../demo.php' data-highlight='1-36')
    :markdown
      ### Call RingCentral Platform APIs
      Now let's create a file named `demo.php` and use the `RingCentral` class as shown in the demo code on the right-hand side.

      In this demo, we implement 2 test functions:

      `get_account_extension()`:

      We use the `get()` function from the RingCentral class to get account extensions' information and print them out on the console.

      `send_sms()`:

      We use the `post()` function from the RingCentral class to send an SMS message to a `recipientNumber` and print the response out on the console.

      ### Run the demo app.
      ```
      $ php demo.php
      ```

      You can further develop the RingCentral class to add PUT and DELETE methods as you wish.
